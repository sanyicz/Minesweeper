# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game made with Python.
How to play:
You can set the size of the playing field, namely the number of tiles. If you left-click on a button on the playing field, you reveal the tile under it. A tile can contain a mine, in this case the game is over, or a number representing the number of mines in the adjacent tiles. If you right-click on a button, you can mark it as a mine. You win, when all the mines are marked and every other tile is revealed.
